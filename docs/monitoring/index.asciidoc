{monitoring} in {kib} serves two separate purposes:

. To visualize monitoring data from across the {stack}. You can view health and 
performance data for {es}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as analyze past 
performance. 
. To monitor {kib} itself and route that data to the monitoring cluster.

If you enable {monitoring} across the Elastic Stack, a monitoring agent runs on
each {es} node, Logstash node, {kib} instance, and Beat to collect and index
metrics. Each node and instance is considered unique based on its persistent
UUID, which is written to the <<settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node
or instance starts.

For more information, see <<monitoring-kibana>> and 
{stack-ov}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the {stack}].
