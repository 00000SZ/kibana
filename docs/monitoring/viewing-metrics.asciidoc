== Viewing monitoring data in {kib}
++++
<titleabbrev>Viewing monitoring data</titleabbrev>
++++

After you collect monitoring data for one or more products in the {stack}, you 
can configure {kib} to retrieve that information and display it in on the 
*Monitoring* page.

At a minimum, you must have monitoring data for the {es} production cluster.
Once that data exists, {kib} can display monitoring data for other products in
the cluster.

TIP: If you have a dedicated monitoring cluster, the information is accessible
even if the {es} cluster you're monitoring is not. You can send data from
multiple clusters to the same monitoring cluster and view them all through the
same instance of {kib}. To learn more about typical monitoring architectures 
with separate production and monitoring clusters, see
{stack-ov}/how-monitoring-works.html[How monitoring works].

. {ref}/configuring-monitoring.html[Configure monitoring in {es}]. If you want
to use a separate monitoring cluster, see
{stack-ov}/monitoring-production.html[Monitoring in a production environment].

. Optional: <<monitoring-kibana,Configure monitoring in {kib}>>.

. Optional: {logstash-ref}/configuring-logstash.html[Configure monitoring in Logstash].

. Optional: Configure monitoring in {auditbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Auditbeat],
{filebeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Filebeat],
{heartbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Heartbeat],
{metricbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Metricbeat],
{packetbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Packetbeat], and
{winlogbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Winlogbeat].

. Configure {kib} to visualize monitoring data:

.. Verify that `xpack.monitoring.ui.enabled` is set to `true`, which is the
default value. For more information, see <<monitoring-settings-kb>>.

.. Identify where to retrieve monitoring data from. If you want to use a
separate _monitoring cluster_, set `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` in the
`kibana.yml` file. Otherwise, the monitoring data is stored in the production
cluster.
+
--
TIP: If {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, use an HTTPS
URL such as `https://<your_monitoring_cluster>:9200` in this setting.

--

.. If {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, identify a user
ID and password that {kib} can use to retrieve monitoring data. Specify these
values in the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username` and 
`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password` settings in the `kibana.yml` file.
If these settings are omitted, {kib} uses the `elasticsearch.username` and
`elasticsearch.password` setting values.

.. If {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, configure {kib}
to encrypt communications between the {kib} server and the monitoring cluster. 
Specify the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.*` settings in the `kibana.yml` 
file on the {kib} server.
+
--
For example, if you are using your own certificate authority to sign
certificates, specify the location of the PEM file in the `kibana.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: /path/to/your/cacert.pem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. 
+
--
If you are running {kib} locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. 

If {security-features} are enabled on the {kib} server, to access {kib} and view the 
monitoring dashboards, you must log in as a user who has the `kibana_user` and 
`monitoring_user` roles. These roles have the necessary privileges to view the 
monitoring dashboards. For more information, see 
{stack-ov}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in roles].

If you are accessing a remote monitoring cluster, you must log in to {kib}
with credentials that are valid on both the {kib} server and the monitoring 
cluster.
--

. In the side navigation, click *Monitoring*. The first time you open {kib}
monitoring, data collection is
disabled. You will be prompted to turn on data collection.
+
If you have permission to turn on data collection and there is data in the cluster,
{kib} displays the monitoring dashboards.  You'll see cluster alerts
that require your attention and a summary of the available monitoring metrics
for {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and Beats. To view additional information, click the
Overview, Nodes, Indices, or Instances links.
