      Its not that you're not connected to any data. Maybe you are, maybe you're not. But if you
      are, I don't know about it. I looked for a data source in your expression, because I really
      wanted to give you a fancy interface to it. Alas, I could not find one that I know about.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm just going to trust that you know what you're doing. You look smart. We should hang out
      more. What are you doing Thursday?
